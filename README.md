# NFC-Event-Check-In

This is an Android based event check-in system using a single NFC tag. Attendees will use their NFC enabled smartphones to tap the tag, triggering the app to log their check-in. 
The system is intended for events like workshops, seminars or small gatherings to give a cost-effective and efficient solution for managing attendance.

This is purely a test project to help me explore NFC technology
